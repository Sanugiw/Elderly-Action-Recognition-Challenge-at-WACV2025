**Elderly Action Recognition Challenge at WACV 2025**
A transformer-based multi-modal solution that integrates RGB, optical flow, and pose features to recognize elderly Activities of Daily Living.

**Three-stream architecture:**

* **RGB Stream:** Video Transformer for spatial-temporal understanding
* **Pose Stream:** Graph CNN for body joint dynamics
* **Optical Flow Stream:** CNN-LSTM for motion representation

**Dataset:** Based on the Toyota Smarthome dataset containing videos of elderly individuals performing daily activities in realistic home environments.

**Goal:** Achieve accuracy exceeding 0.842
